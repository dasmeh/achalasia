**Idiopathic Achalasia Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)**

Idiopathic achalasia (IA) is a rare condition marked by the degeneration of neurons in the myenteric plexus, leading to impaired oesophageal function. Despite proposed immune-mediated mechanisms, the underlying etiopathology remains unclear. This project conducted the first GWAS on 4,602 European IA patients and 10,766 controls, identifying key genetic risk factors:

HLA-DQB1: A SNP causing an 8-amino-acid insertion (OR=2.43, P=4.65x10⁻⁶⁸) as the strongest risk factor, with further independent signals at HLA-DQα1 and HLA-DQβ1.
Non-HLA Genes: SNPs in UGT1A8 (OR=2.50), PTPN22 (OR=1.29), and others implicate oesophageal defense and immune response.
Polygenic Insights: SNP-based heritability is 12.15%, with shared etiopathology with Crohn’s disease (rg=0.269).
Integrating GWAS with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the myenteric plexus highlighted CD8+ T cell subsets (FOS+Tc4+ and ZNF683+Tc5+) as central players in IA development. These findings provide novel insights into the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying IA.

Our gene prioritization is based on Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation [MAGMA](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004219).
